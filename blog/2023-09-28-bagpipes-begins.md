# Workflow builder for cross-chain infrastructure.

This powerful no-code interface opens the door to a new realm of possibilities, and makes it seamless and accessible for anyone to design, build and automate their blockchain workflows.

_This basic workflow just does one action, sends DOT to AssetHub. It gets interesting when you add multiple actions._

<!--truncate-->

We’ve completed the first step a nodal canvass that enables you to send XCM reserve backed transfers. This is very basic and can be done on various chain apps and wallets. However, stand by, the next stage is where it gets a little more interesting… and the possibilities will start to become exponential.

The initial project name is “xcm send” www.xcmsend.com.

In the first milestone we focussed on the basic sending an asset across chains.

In the second milestone we will focus on the following scenario.



Sprouting from the Substrate ecosystem, it will soon become seamless to weave together very useful workflows on a visual canvass.

## Workflow Scenario:

### Exchange DOT for USDt (and hold on AssetHub)
Consider the scenario where we want to swap some DOT for USDt and then hold the currency on Asset Hub. This requires multiple (signing and sending) actions:

**< 1. Transfer → 2. Swap → 3. Transfer >**

1. Transfer DOT to a DEX.
First, we send our DOT to Acala, Hydra — or another parachain which has a dex — via a reserve backed asset transfer. We can use almost any substrate supported wallet for this.
2. Swap DOT for USDt
Then we swap the DOT for the USDt on Hydra. We probably need to use the Hydra app for this (though some wallet may support this).
3. Then send the USDt to Asset Hub.
Here we needed to make 3 actions to exchange our DOT for USDt and hold it on AssetHub (and we may have even used 2 platforms to do this).

**From 3 actions (on ~2 apps) into…**

## 1 action on 1 platform.

_A workflow comprised of multiple actions all wrapped into one action on one platform. Just press start sign all at the same time then which the transactions happen in front of your eyes. (coming soon)_

## Playground of possibilities

The above scenario is just an example of workflows can be created. As we add more features from different changes, combined with a fun and intuitive birds eye view canvass, the possibilities will exponentially increase and will unlock plenty of innovative applications.

We would love to talk to you and find what problems you have, what features you would like to see, and what useful and important workflow you need. This will directly inform how we prioritise our work.

You can reach out at bagpipes@xcmsend.com and either (or both) myself (Ramsey Ajram) and Filip Kalebo, lead engineers, will receive the message and respond to you. If you want to join our beta tester group, just email us.
