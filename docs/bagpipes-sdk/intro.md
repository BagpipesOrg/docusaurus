# Getting Started

The SDK contains two key features, Wallets and Chains. These are both key parts of creating a DApp with Polkadot. 

We have very simple examples that contains templates for you to begin building your DApp with "connect to wallet extension" already added to your App, so you can very easily create DApps that your users can use their wallet extensions with.
