# Getting Started

The SDK contains two key features, `Wallet` and `Chains`. These are both key parts of creating a DApp with Polkadot, or any other chain. 

We have very simple examples that contains templates for you to begin building your DApp. So you can very easily create DApps that your users can use their wallet extensions to sign transactions with, and interact with chains.

Our `Wallet Kit` and `Chains Kit` tutorials will show you how to use these features independently as well as together.
