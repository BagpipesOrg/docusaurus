# Wallet Kit Intro

Bagpipes Wallet Kit makes it seamlessly simple for you to add Polkadot and EVM wallet extensions into your DApp. We currently support Talisman, Polkadot Extension and SubWallet. 

Soon we will add Nova QR, Wallet Connect and Metamask, which will essentially support almost all crypto wallets.

You can get up and running in minutes by using our [ DApp Template example](/docs/bagpipes-sdk/Wallet%20Kit/Examples/hello-wallet.md).

And you can explore the docs.
