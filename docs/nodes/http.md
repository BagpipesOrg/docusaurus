# Http Node

A HTTP allows you to make almost any kind of HTTP(s) request on the internet! When you use this node to make an HTTP request, the response data (or event data) can be used in your workflow. It's a very powerful node that unlocks a lot of possibilities. 

See [webhook](/nodes/webhook.md) for an example that uses the http node.
