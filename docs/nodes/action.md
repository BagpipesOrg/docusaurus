# Action Node

You can drag in an action node between two chains, the action is either xTransfer or Swap.


## Actions

Actions are otherwise referred to as blockchain transactions or extrinsics, which is something that is signed by a user and put on-chain. 

### xTransfer 

xTransfer = Cross chain transfer

`xTransfer` is an action that represents transferring assets across chains. xTransfer can be a teleport, or a reserve asset transfer, etc.   

### Swap   

Swap = Selling on asset for another asset on a decentralized exchange.  

_Note: we currently only support HydraDx to HydraDx swaps at the moment._
