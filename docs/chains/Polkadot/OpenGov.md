You can combine voting in opengov with sending DOT hold on parachains with an XCM transfer to Polkadot then trigger a vote.

## Delegate voting power:  
If you are staking or just holding `$DOT` you can delegate voting power to more active voters. This lets you keep the DOT but delegate the responsibility to vote in OpenGov to someone else. With Bagpipes you can delegate to any polkadot address on [all tracks](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#origins-and-tracks).
